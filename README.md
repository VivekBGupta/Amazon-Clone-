I have divided the HTML part into 5 sections &amp; accordingly implemented the required CSS properties to style in an appropriate manner. 
The HTML part contains the header, main content in 3 parts, and sign in section. where the header part contains the navbar,details with the logo in the left.
Also it contains second web page as product info.
